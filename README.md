antikvar-musene
===============

Hack4no project to make a javascript file for connecting the unimus.no and
ra.no open databases through API calls.

An html file is currently used as a helper for formatting and debugging. 
Search is not implemented; but there is not much left to do so (hopefully).

Installing, Running, and Requirements
=====================================

The javascript file does not use any libraries (to my knowledge atleast), so 
running it requires only an internet browser capable of running javascript. 
Serving it as a webpage should also require only a http server of some kind.
